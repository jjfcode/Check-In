Create a simple web app using HTML and CSS for a class check-in system. The app should have the following features:

- A title input field where I can enter the name of the class happening now.
- A form for attendees to enter their full name, company name, email, and optionally phone number.
- A checkbox that users can select if they are interested in future classes.
- A submit button that saves the entered data.
- When the form is submitted, the data should be saved into an Excel file.

Please generate the HTML and CSS code for the interface, including form fields and styling. Also, suggest how to handle saving data into an Excel file, considering that the app is currently built with only HTML and CSS (so no backend). If needed, mention that saving to Excel would require additional backend or JavaScript code, such as using a library or exporting data as CSV.
